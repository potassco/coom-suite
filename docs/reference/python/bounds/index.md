# Bounds

This module solves instances with unbounded cardinalities in an incremental fashion.
A `max_bound` is used to turn all unbounded cardinalities into bounded cardinalities.
This `max_bound` is increased (and possibly also decreased) until a (minimal) bound is found.

This can be done using standard single-shot solving or multi-shot solving.
Both approaches use a common [solver class][solver].

[solver]: solver.md

The `max_bound` can either be increased in a `linear` or `exponential` fashion.
In both approaches it is possible to supply an initial value.

Once a satisfiable `max_bound` has been found, solving continues to compute what the minimal satisfiable value for `max_bound` is.
